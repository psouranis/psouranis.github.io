## Welcome to My Blog!
Hi there! I’m Panagiotis Souranis, a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over four years of experience in crafting data-driven solutions that make a real impact. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and two Master's degrees in Statistics and Artificial Intelligence, both with high distinction. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in advanced analytics, modeling, and visualization, allowing me to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

## What I Do
Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Deutsche-Telekom in Thessaloniki. Here, I’ve had the exciting opportunity to design features for our data analytics platform, including a natural language processing interface that lets users explore data using everyday language. I also created an LLM documentation chatbot to help our users get instant answers to their questions. Before this, I was a Senior Data Science Analyst at Accenture, where I worked with big data technologies to enhance network reliability in the telecommunications industry. It was a fantastic experience that deepened my understanding of how data can drive business success.

## My Passion
I thrive on teamwork and love continuous learning. I’m always exploring the latest advancements in data science and machine learning, eager to apply innovative ideas to solve real-world problems. Recently, I even took home 1st place in the Prediction Agent Hackathon for developing AI tools in prediction markets!
